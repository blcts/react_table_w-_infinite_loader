Frontend test case  
You need to write a small application in React + Typescript. The application is 
written only through function components and hooks, it is forbidden to use 
classes.  
The following features in application must be implemented:  
1.  A table that can contain an arbitrary number of fields (from 5 to 15).  
2.  The data in the table must be loaded from the server.  
3.  Use "Infinite Loader" to load new data.  !!!!!
4.  State manager (or lack thereof, justify the choice or lack of a tool).  
5.  In the form of creating a new record in the table, there must be at least 5  fields  
Notes:  
i.Keep in mind that there can be any number of fields  
ii.Fields must contain validation (at least mandatory or complex like a valid  
email address)  !!!!!
iii.Must have appropriate checks before submitting (disable buttons or 
others) 
iv.The server may not accept the form and return errors (you may not 
implement it, but describe the implementation)  
6.  The form must be submitted via the API. The entry is made in the table  
7.  Add any animation (for example popup with a form, use something more 
complicated than simple CSS animations) 
8.  Upload code to github.   
The use of any third-party libraries is allowed (but you will need to justify their 
use).  
For UI you can use any component library or framework (bootstrap, chakra, 
material, etc.).  
For the API, you can use https://github.com/typicode/json-server file c db must 
be attached to the project.
