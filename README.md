State manager (or lack thereof, justify the choice or lack of a tool).
In the form of creating a new record in the table, there must be at least 5 fields
Notes:
i.Keep in mind that there can be any number of fields
ii.Fields must contain validation (at least mandatory or complex like a valid
email address) !!!!! iii.Must have appropriate checks before submitting (disable buttons or others) iv.The server may not accept the form and return errors (you may not implement it, but describe the implementation)
The form must be submitted via the API. The entry is made in the table
Add any animation (for example popup with a form, use something more complicated than simple CSS animations)
Upload code to github.
The use of any third-party libraries is allowed (but you will need to justify their use).
For UI you can use any component library or framework (bootstrap, chakra, material, etc.).
For the API, you can use https://github.com/typicode/json-server file c db must be attached to the project.
